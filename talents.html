            <p id="talentText"> one of my talents is to take photos. (I took these 
            pictures) ever since i got my first phone when i was six, i 
            found my talent of taking pictures. The picture on the left was 
            taken when i was on a school trip to dc, and the gorilla
             picture was taken when i went to the zoo with my family. </p>
